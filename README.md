# DOMINION
Random-data generating Algorithm for experimental Quake III Machinima Purposes

DOMINION is an algorithm written in JavaScript that generates random data for the sole purpose of experimental Quake III Machinima Purposes. 
Consisting of six different parts, DOMINION calculates various aspects such as film runtime, amount of maps, amount of shots and duration plus various parameters for use in Quake III MovieMakers Edition.
DOMINION also randomly calculates the entire post-production process by telling which shot, version and length are required at any point in your NLE timeline. The algorithm is still a work-in-progress as improvements and adjustments are made.
